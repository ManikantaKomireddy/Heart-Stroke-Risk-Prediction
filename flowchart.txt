1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset - stroke data
3. visualization using seaborn & Plotly
4. Univariate and BiVariate Analysis 
5. SMOTE Oversampling
6. Data processing 
    - Hybird Deep Learning
	- stacking the values
	- Converting the stack value into tensor
	- stacking the continuous columns & converting to tensor
	- converting target variable to tensor and flattening since CrossEntropyLoss expects a 1-d tensor
    - Deep Neural Network and CNN + LSTM
	- Data Normalizing
	- Data Transform
    - Machine Learning
7. Label Encoding
8. Feature Selection and Splitting the Data into train and test
6. building the model
	- Hybird Deep TL
	- DNN
	- CNN + LSTM
	- SVM
	- DT
    	- RF
	- Voting Classifier
	
7. training the model
8. building the model with Voting Classifier since it gives better score and less MSE comparing with Other Models 
9. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
10. importing the packages
11. User gives input as Feature Values 
12. the given input is preprocessed for prediction
13. trained model is used for prediction
14. final outcome is displayed through frontend

Note:

Extension -Voting Classifier, CNN+LSTM model is build as Extension for feature values
and Voting Classifier is used for prediction since we it gives better score value comparing with other Models
